The archives contains previous scripts that do not necessarilly have less functionality.
The only script here, uses whiptail to select/deselect devices to be allowed or blocked.
Whiptail is fairly easy to implement, but it is not as nice as the current selector, which runs
directly into the terminal. I wanted to have the sameish feeling as the github cli or aws-cli interface
